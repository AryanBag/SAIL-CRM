# SAIL-CRM
Engineered a PID controller on an Arduino Opta PLC for a cold rolling mill's DC motors. Achieved 18% greater speed stability, >40% sensor noise reduction using Kalman+IIR filters, and 22% faster speed transition settling times with a custom thyristor firing module for precise torque control.
